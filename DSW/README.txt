This is the full implementation of all the changes we are supposed to implement into the BST assignment. Included is the PDF file with the answers to Task 5. I was able to use the make files as always but for some reason could not get the custom error handling to work so I removed it from the file. Otherwise, there are still edge cases in the fucntions to handle the cases of trying to access null values.
